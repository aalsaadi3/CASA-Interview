Environment Setup

    We created a basic C# Project in Visual Studio Code in Windows 10.
    In our local Github Folder, we created the repository "CASA-Interview".
    We navigated to the directory path using File explorer and launched
    Windows Command Prompt. We entered "dotnet new console" followed by
    "code ." to launch our current Environment of choice, which is 
    Visual Studio Code.

Program Explanation

We add System.Diagnostics and System.Threading in lines 5 and 6 to measure speed
and time of program execution (more on these namespaces later). I

Down in lines 39 - 58 we make our IsPrime method. We decide to use a for loop and
if/else logic to achieve our goal. 




***we don't need to waste time with even number iterations if our number is odd,
figure something out about that.
