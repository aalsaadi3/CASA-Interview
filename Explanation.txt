Environment Setup

    We created a basic C# Project in Visual Studio Code in Windows 10.
    In our local Github Folder, we created the repository "CASA-Interview".
    We navigated to the directory path using File explorer and launched
    Windows Command Prompt. We entered "dotnet new console" followed by
    "code ." to launch our current Environment of choice, which is 
    Visual Studio Code.

Program Explanation

    We use Program.cs for all our work in the application.

    We add System.Diagnostics to measure speed and time of program execution (more on 
    this namespace later). I

    In our IsPrime method, we decide to rule out several numbers using if statements.
    We rule out numbers from most common to least common non-prime numbers:
    #1) Negative numbers, 0 and 1
    #2) Even numbers besides 2
    #3) Multiples of 3, 5, and 7 (except for those numbers themselves)

    Numbers not meeting any of the above criteria will go through for loop iterations.
    We have a divisibilty counter that auto increments if n is found to be completely divisible
    by the index of the current iteration. If the counter exceeds 2, it will automatically 
    break out of the loop prevent unnecessary iterations as the n is clearly not prime.

    Only if the counter equals 2 will the number the function return true since n is prime.

    Notice in our main method we use a Stopwatch object from the System.Diagnostics namespace.
    We first use it to log number of ticks taken For application to start and gather user input.
    We reset it and use it again to log number of ticks taken to typecast input to integer,
    pass it to the IsPrime function and output the result.
